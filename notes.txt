    - things like validation only need to be initialized for contact page
    - lazy loading & magnific only on the gallery
- get package.json together (via npm init)

- Hugo static site generator has a templating language
- mustache logic-less templates might be a better option
- but handlebar js includes block expressions (iterators, etc)

Dropdown menus don't work without js turned on???

double check email address


Test forms by posting to google forms!

Crop photos to text block size in ovations page and then vertically align!

For ovations page, flow text AROUND image on mobile.


scroll bar was the thing causing that odd shifting


https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache
- this with a js task runner is probably the way to go

            -->


  !!! - Importnant !!!
  The higher the width:height ration, the more difficult it is to resize to long block of text!

  no wrapping on FAQ.  mutliple headers wrapping would seem weird.

  For today
  - Need pictures!
  - If you've cropped something for the ID pages, I need orig cropped just like that.


  For later:
  - how can i make this deterministic? when I know i have a two column layout and i want to match text & image height (with fixed width)
    - vary aspect ratio
    - vary font-size
  - it might be worth it to mixin with img-fluid
    - i sometimes want to "cancel" the lg or xl adjustment
      - the grid still keeps things centered

  Stylistic notes
  - a high height:width file looks bad occupying a row on a large screen. (b/c it's huge!)

  bio
  - it might be easier to do two simple columns with font adjustments at lg, xl, then line up everything else

  !!! - something i've mixed
  - text boxes (and therefore text lines) don't resize continuously
    they "jump" at the same time the picture does
  - so i can match sizes at the breakpoints, then i'm good!


  ??? - will fonts be consistent size (at same pxl height) compared to picture
        across browsers?
        https://zellwk.com/blog/responsive-typography/

  blog post about this could be fun
  - matching sizes, responsive typography, corss browser, etc
  - is pulling up style info to makrkup good?
    - it's declarative that way
      - stylesheets aren't entirely declarative??? (i actually don't know)
  - border height w/ negative margins on child block elems and offsetting marg on block above
