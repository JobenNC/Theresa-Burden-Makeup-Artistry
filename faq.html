                    <p class="answer">
                        There are a few reasons on why it is a good idea to
                        invest in professional makeup artistry and in licensed
                        professionals. If this is for a wedding or a special event,
                        you are going to be center stage. Knowing that all eyes
                        will be on you, you want to look your best so you can

                        Estheticians are known as skin therapists. Estheticians

                        I do not charge for local travel. The first 20 miles are
                        complimentary! This is calculated from my residence to

                        While every artist, including myself has their own
                        style, I still customize all my clients makeup to their
                        individual needs and preferences. I have a few
                        goals: I need for you to still feel like you, and have
                        the makeup extenuate your best features as well as

                        I use many different brands that are geared towards
                        professional use. I enjoy using Viseart, RCMA, Kevyn
                        Aucoin, Senna Cosmetics, Makeup Forever, and
                        Graftobian to name a few. I use high quality brushes

                    <p class="answer">
                        I only use hypoallergenic products. If you have sensitive
                        skin, I highly recommend doing a trial because we can do
                        a patch test before your event. If you have products of
                        your own that you would prefer me to use I can definitely

                        I don’t use airbrush tools, but the foundations I use

                        are professional quality. Any type of coverage is light-
                        weight and appears skin like. All of my clients are also
